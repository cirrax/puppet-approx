## Overview

This module is used to configure approx. Approx is a caching proxy for 
Debian (and derivative) packages requested by apt-get. 

For puppet versions < 4.0, use the 1.x.x Versions.

## Usage

To start using approx you need to include the approx main class and
add the urls you like to make available.

A minimal example might be:

~~~
class{'approx'}

approx::repository{'debian':
  url => 'http://ftp.ch.debian.org/debian',
}

approx::repository{'debian-security':
  url => 'http://security.debian.org/debian-security',
}
~~~

If you like to use hiera, you can define:

~~~
---
approx::config:
  debian:
      url: 'http://ftp.ch.debian.org/debian'
  debian-security:
      url: 'http://security.debian.org/debian-security'
~~~

## Systemd
Newer debian systems using systemd use a systemd socket to configure the listening port/ip.
To change where approx listen, include the class approx::systemd\_socket and set the $listen\_streams.
